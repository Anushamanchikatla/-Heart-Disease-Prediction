# -Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model using neural networks to identify the presence of heart disease based on patient data. The model will be trained on a dataset containing various health indicators such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the goal is to accurately classify patients as either having or not having heart disease. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment to enable real-time predictions on new patient data.


1. Data Collection: Get a dataset with patient features and heart disease labels.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and split data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Architecture: Design a simple neural network with input, hidden, and output layers.

4. Activation Functions: Use ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer.

5. Loss Function and Optimizer: Apply binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

6. Model Training: Compile, train, and validate the model using training data.

7. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

8. Model Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, layers, and neurons for better performance.
